# usefulscripts
A repository of scripts that I've found helpful and use pretty often.

# docker-setup.sh
Builds out Docker and docker-compose on the machine.

# update-docker-images.sh
As implied by the name, will update all of the Docker images on the machine and remove all images that have the <none> tag.

# zombie-killer.sh
Finds and stops all zombie processes.
